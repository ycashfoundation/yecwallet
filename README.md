# Installation

Head over to the releases page and grab the latest installers or binary. https://github.com/ycashfoundation/zecwallet/releases

### Linux

If you are on Debian/Ubuntu, please download the `.deb` package and install it.
```
sudo dpkg -i linux-deb-zecwallet-v0.1.deb
sudo apt install -f
```

Or you can download and run the binaries directly.
```
tar -xvf zecwallet-v0.1.tar.gz
./zecwallet-v0.1/zecwallet
```

### Windows
Download and run the `.msi` installer and follow the prompts. Alternately, you can download the release binary, unzip it and double click on `zecwallet.exe` to start.

### macOS
Double-click on the `.dmg` file to open it, and drag `zecwallet` on to the Applications link to install.

## zcashd
ZecWallet needs a Zcash node running zcashd. If you already have a zcashd node running, ZecWallet will connect to it. 

If you don't have one, ZecWallet will start its embedded zcashd node. 

Additionally, if this is the first time you're running ZecWallet or a zcashd daemon, ZecWallet will download the zcash params (~1.7 GB) and configure `ycash.conf` for you. 

Pass `--no-embedded` to disable the embedded zcashd and force ZecWallet to connect to an external node.

## Compiling from source
ZecWallet is written in C++ 14, and can be compiled with g++/clang++/visual c++. It also depends on Qt5, which you can get from [here](https://www.qt.io/download). Note that if you are compiling from source, you won't get the embedded zcashd by default. You can either run an external zcashd, or compile zcashd as well. 

See detailed build instructions [on the wiki](https://github.com/ycashfoundation/zecwallet/wiki/Compiling-from-source-code)

### Building on Linux

```
git clone https://github.com/ycashfoundation/zecwallet.git
cd zecwallet
/path/to/qt5/bin/qmake zec-qt-wallet.pro CONFIG+=debug
make -j$(nproc)

./zecwallet
```

### Building on Windows
You need Visual Studio 2017 (The free C++ Community Edition works just fine). 

From the VS Tools command prompt
```
git clone  https://github.com/ycashfoundation/zecwallet.git
cd zecwallet
c:\Qt5\bin\qmake.exe zec-qt-wallet.pro -spec win32-msvc CONFIG+=debug
nmake

debug\zecwallet.exe
```

To create the Visual Studio project files so you can compile and run from Visual Studio:
```
c:\Qt5\bin\qmake.exe zec-qt-wallet.pro -tp vc CONFIG+=debug
```

### Building on macOS
You need to install the Xcode app or the Xcode command line tools first, and then install Qt. 

```
git clone https://github.com/ycashfoundation/zecwallet.git
cd zecwallet
/path/to/qt5/bin/qmake zec-qt-wallet.pro CONFIG+=debug
make

./zecwallet.app/Contents/MacOS/zecwallet
```
